sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Has the same speed results as Selection sort except when run on a sorted list it has a speed that looks closer to Omega(n).

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Because this program consitantly has very similar run times across all tests. It also scales sonsitantly with O(n log n) and Omega(n log n).

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: The speed seems to scale at what looks like O(n**2) or Omega(n**2) no matter which test is ran.
