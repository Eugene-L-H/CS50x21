      <p class="intro">In an effort to learn software development and computer science I have worked through several different online courses. Here displayed are the certificates that I have earned from those courses along with a brief summary of my experience. Further cerificates will be added.

        </div>
        <p>Harvard's CS50 is an amazing experience and a very challenging course for a beginner.<script> for (let i =0; i < 2; i++) { document.write("</br>")}</script>
          This certificate serves as a placeholder. I haven't quite earned mine yet.

        <h2>The Complete Python Programmer Bootcamp 2020</h2>

        </div>
        <p>When becoming more seriously interested in programming I became a fan of Giles YouTube channel which was primarily focused on the Python programming language. When he announced that he had created and released a Udemy course I purchased it and began without hesitation.</p>

      <div class="certificateBox floatLeft">
        <h2>Python Core Course - Sololearn</h2>  
        <div class="certPhotos"> 
          <img src="certificate_images/python_sololearn.jpg" alt="Sololearn, Python"/>
        </div>
        <p>A course I did through the website/app "Sololearn".  I decided to pick up the "Python Core Course" to compliment the learning I was doing in the Python Programmer Udemy course. This course was very helpful in reinforcing core concepts through short lessons, multiple choice questions and short excercises completed in a virtual programming environment.<script> var i; for (i =0; i < 2; i++) { document.write("</br>")}</script> As a relative beginner at the time, this course took me at least 30hrs to complete.</p>
