# CS50x21

A collection of the files from my submissions to Harvard University's CS50x course. I started the course in late August 2020 and finished in April 2021.
CS50 was an intense (for me), sometimes frustrating, but ultimately rewarding experience. I am sure that it was not the most efficient way earn employable skills (will I ever program in C?), however I am very glad that I completed it. I imagine that the approach of learning from the hardware up, so to speak, coding in the C programming language using pointers, having to allocate and free memory, and working with data structures and algorithms will serve me well in my future understanding of CS and software development.

Looking at the curriculum for CS50 as a beginner I thought I would be a very competent developer by the course's end, but once finished I realized that it was only a beginning. There is so much to understand in the feild of CS and software development, and there is constant evolution happening all the time. Triage will be a valuable skill; learning what to spend time on learning and what not to will be very important.
